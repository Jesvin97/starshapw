## 📝 Key Takeaway for Client
*"We agreed on ₹85,000. While we removed the **Website (₹18k)**, we added the **Financial Module (₹30k)** which was never in the original quote. This module (Bank Integration, Partner Ledgers, Cash Flow) is the 'Brain' of your business and is worth far more than a simple landing page. You effectively got a robust Accounting ERP for the price of a simple Order Management system."*
